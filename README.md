1-Create schema that name 'wedding' in MySQL
2-Open project in IDE and enter DBConnection.java file. 
3-Change 'username' and 'password' for your mysql database. 

The first time you run the project, enter 'founder' in the username and password to login to the manager page.

Managers with founder authority can admin delete and add. But managers without founder authority can't. All managers can add, delete wedding hall and view reservations.

If you get error about jdatechooser, follow this steps(I explain for Intellij Idea):
File->Project Structure->Modules->Dependencies->Click '+' button->JARs or Directories->Enter the project file and choose jcalendar-1.4.jar--
--->Click check button->Click 'OK' button
